## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰:
* ATLIQ Mart faced service challenges, resulting in some key customers not renewing their contracts. As part of the analytics team, I worked to uncover insights that could improve service levels and drive business decisions.

## 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐳𝐞𝐝:
* 📊 On-Time Delivery (OT%): Measuring timely shipments.
* 📊 In-Full Delivery (IF%): Tracking complete fulfillment of orders.
* 📊 On-Time In-Full (OTIF%): Combining OT% and IF% to assess overall performance.
* 📊 Line Fill Rate (LFIR%) and Volume Fill Rate (VOFR%): Evaluating fulfillment at line and volume levels.

## 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:
* The overall 𝐎𝐓𝐈𝐅% 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝟏𝟔.𝟏𝟑%, significantly below the target of 66%, with cities like Ahmedabad and Surat showing similar trends.
* In-Full (IF%) delivery was at 52.78%, and On-Time (OT%) delivery at 59.03%, highlighting delays and incomplete deliveries.
* Major products like AM Biscuits and AM Curd had higher VOFR and LFIR percentages, suggesting product-level performance insights.

## 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:
* 🔹 Power BI: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize performance trends and identify problem areas.
* 🔹 Data Segmentation: Split data by customers, products, and cities for detailed analysis.

## 💡 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬:
* This project demonstrated the power of data in addressing operational inefficiencies. 
* By identifying gaps in OTIF performance, ATLIQ Mart can take targeted actions to improve customer satisfaction, laying the groundwork for successful expansion into new markets.
